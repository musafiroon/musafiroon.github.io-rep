This is the jquery library

you can use the musafiroonCode.js library for only having my codes

I have added my code to the jquery file.

It is free to use.

my code definition:-
```javascript
   random(startfrom,endAt);
   ```
this returns a random value between firstValue and lastValue 

```javascript
random(1,10);//returns a number between 1 and 10
```
